PS-NimbleStorage
================

Just a collection of PowerShell functions I've built and partially consolidated from others from others along the way to assist in optimizing Nimble Storage arrays integrated into VMware ESXi infrastructure.

Fuction1: Set-NimbleIopsRR - this function will step through each Nimble Storage disk attached to an ESXi host and set the recommended IO path switching values per Nimble Storage best practices.

Function2: Set-NimblePSP - this function will step through each Nimble Storage disk attached to an ESXi host and set the recommended IO paths switching values as well as the recommended VMware multi-pathing per Nimble Storage best practices.
